Channel Coding: Theory and Applications in LTE Networks

This paper examines the Concept of Channel Coding
in Digital communications system, it starts with a brief summary
of Information theory and Source coding then moves on to channel coding concepts like Rectangular codes, Hamming Distance
and Odd parity. Next, linear block codes were introduced and
finally Convolutional codes were explored culminating in their
main application in LTE systems (i.e Turbo Codes). SIMULINK
models were then used to simulate the Channel coding schemes in
a wider communications system over a wide range of parameters,
the results clarified the reasons why certain standards are used
in modern communication systems (6144 bit codeblocks in LTE
communications and 1/3-coderates for tailbiting codes).
